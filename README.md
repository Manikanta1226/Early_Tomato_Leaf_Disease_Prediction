# Early_Tomato_Leaf_Disease_Prediction

A deep learning-based project for early detection and classification of tomato leaf diseases. This project utilizes CNN, ResNet50, VGG16, and AlexNet to assist farmers in boosting crop yield and promoting sustainable agriculture.

🚀 Project Overview:
Tomato crops are vulnerable to a range of diseases, impacting both quality and yield. Early diagnosis is essential for timely treatment and productivity. This project classifies tomato leaf images into healthy or diseased categories using deep learning techniques.

🧠 Key Features:
📸 Dataset: 8,834 images (healthy & diseased leaves), sourced from Kaggle and real farms in Andhra Pradesh.

🛠️ Preprocessing: Image resizing, batching, and splitting into train/validation sets.

🤖 Models Implemented:

Custom CNN

ResNet50

VGG16

AlexNet

🎯 Best Accuracy: 94% training accuracy using a CNN with data augmentation.


📊 Model Performance
Model	Training Accuracy	Validation Accuracy
CNN	94%	93%
ResNet50	68%	73%
VGG16	24%	24%
AlexNet	93%	41%


🔮 Future Enhancements
Implement GoogLeNet, YOLO, and LSTM models.

Expand dataset with more diverse real-time images.

Improve preprocessing and augmentation pipelines.

Build a web-based prediction tool for field deployment.
